/*Develop a Java application that determines the gross pay for each 
of three employees. The company pays straight time for the first 40 
hours worked by each employee and time and a half for all hours worked 
in excess of 40. Youâ€™re given a list of the employees, their number 
of hours worked last week and their hourly rates. Your program should 
input this information for each employee, then determine and display 
the employeeâ€™s gross pay. Use class Scanner to input the data.*/
